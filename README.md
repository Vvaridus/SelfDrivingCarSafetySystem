# SelfDrivingCarSafetySystem

Self-driving cars leave no margin for error in relation to safety and as 
such Ada SPARK has been identified to ensure no runtime errors in the software due to using SPARK to aid in user confidence from a mathematically 
based verification of said software. Within this project SPARK is utilized to 
create a hypothetical perfect system to represent a real-world scenario, a driver 
assistance system for a self-driving electric car. If this system was linked to a 
real car and the correct physical sensors the driver assistance system will be 
able to stop the car from colliding with an object in its path, warn the driver the 
battery is low and ensure, amongst other safety criteria, be able to adhere to the 
speed limit in any area the vehicle is in. The software has been developed within the GNAT Studio IDE. All files have been tested through the “Prove File”
function and meet the SPARK level of at least GOLD standard.
